10,"Very friendly staff, with the most important parameter being that this is the first time I am seeing such an extremely clean and hygienic property completely non-smoking, endless cups of coffee with smoking zone outside, the quiet coffee table area being soothed by the fountain in a pool of open aquarium with lovely fishes, everything so clean that sitting outside for a coffee and a smoke and gazing at the pool with its bubbling pot of water and the sprinkling fountains and the swaying fishes, with the gentle breeze from the woods opposite on the brow, the experience was meditative. All around the property the positive vibes on all the posters with pearls of wisdom and motivational words, with the beautiful wall paint and hangings, the 7 Heaven Boutique Hotel really made us feel like in a peaceful heaven. Inside the room, everything was just right and adequate for a comfortable and soothing stay. Really surprised, and now really happy, to have discovered such a 'family nest' in a quite place. The location is also excellent for business people and visitors of all kinds. Nearby availability of all kinds of food and beverages, banks, shops, temples, malls, hospital and other utility services make the location ideal for visitors of all types. Next time if in Johor Bahru, again it is 7 Heaven Masai-Pasir Gudang for me and family. . Actually we liked everything about this property, as mentioned above.",null
11,"Comfy, convenient, and affordable as always. Check in process is always quick and pleasant. . Floor was sticky upon entering the room. Would suggest the management to consider changing the flooring to something that wouldnt be sticky even after mopping.Would also like to suggest management to consider installing cctv in the elevators and a room card scanner for added security so not just anyone can access the hotel floors.",null

36,"The location of the hotel is near to many shops and restaurants. The room is very clean and the staff is friendly . the smell at the lobby especially during night, maybe it comes from the water fountain. They only provide one pillow for each person and the pillow was too thin and soft",null
37,I like the peaceful and quiet surrouding. The breakfast was nice too and of my tastes. The location is also strategic but unfortunately the weather restrain us from having us to explore more. . There's nothing much to say on this point.,null

59,Location is good for business travelers especially when you are working at Pasir Gudang area. Hotel is also nearby with places to eat. Water pressure in the bathroom is strong which is very nice for shower. . Lobby area was a bit gloomy and quite. Wifi connectivity was not strong enough and always disconnected (maybe for certain area of the floor),null
60,The location and its surrounding businesses. It  provide ample parking and no hassle to check in. . The only thing that stop me from giving a full rating is the fact that for the two deluxe room was without windows. When I booked the rooms we were promised that all rooms were with windows. However when we checked in we were told that the 2 deluxe rooms were without windows due to the fact that the customers that stayed earlier extended their stay. I am surprised that this reason was given. Procedure should be that the earlier customer should move to another room and not the rooms I have been booked for..sigh so unprofessional. That is the only thing that this hotel lacks.. integrity and professionalism.,null

itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs in klia 2 airport but very well connected to the klia 1 terminal and 4 minute away from the express train that connects you either between terminals either to the city centre .
A lot of restaurants around as there is a huge shopping center to pass before you get to the terminal .
Very clean and easy check in or check out.
A bit pricey but a very comfortable stay if you are just stop over before your next flight . A bit pricey , especially for the 12 hours only room.",null

79,"All staff are friendly and responsive. Hotel room is clean and comfortable. . When we arrived hotel was about 11pm and our room got affected by the construction noise (from airport), on and off till 12am. Feedback to hotel staff and they managed to respond quickly.

80,Love the location. Excellent for overnight transit. Clean and comfortable. . The lights too dim,null
81,"Super easy and comfy hotel of you need to be at the airport . They put us in a very tiny room. Didn't look like the pictures. So I went to ask, they said it is the same room but they have it in different sizes.
I told them I wanted what I paid for. If the room sizes are that different (it was for sure 6m2less) then they should handle different prices on those rooms.
So we switched rooms
The picture is of the first room we got. Compare it to the booking.com pictures ;)",null
82,"It was quiet and comfortable . I didn't realize I would be sharing a bathroom, so I think the price was to much for a share bathroom concept.",null

86,Check in was a debarcle!! . Either efficient staff or more staff.,null

Facilities available were nice and enough amenities available for stay. Check-in and out was a breeze! . Cleanliness for the shared bathroom can be improved. Although its good that the staff always clean it whenever it was used. Just it would be good if we have an indicator that showed the shared shower was in use or not, since have to constantly check for it when want to use it.",null
88,"The hotel was just outside security at the airport, only minutes after picking up our bags we were at the hotel. . The water was turned off from 12:30 to 2 am but we were still able to brush our teeth. It wasnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt much of an inconvenience and it was on again for showers in the morning.",null
90,Location within airport and excellent choice for those going for early morning flights or long layover. . The room is quite warm as the A/C thermostat cannot be adjusted. Informed front desk and housekeeping and was reassured that it will take quite a while for it to adjust. Unfortunately it remains the same the whole time.,null
91,The hotel is close to restaurants and the train to get to the airport. . The reception desk staff were brusque and not as friendly as we'd experienced at 5 other hotels during our travels. We had to wait a long while to be seen to.  There was no-one present at the desk when we had to leave our key in the very early morning.,null
93,"Located right inside a mall that has a food court, pharmacy, grocery .... . Price over-rated for a window-less room and basic amenities.",null

95,Clean and location (it is inside the airport) . Flexible checking in,null
96,"I always value a decent transit hotel, and Aerotel certainly fits the bill. Its convenient location is a significant advantage, making it an ideal choice for travelers on layovers. The standout feature for us was the availability of family rooms. Traveling with a group of four, we found the room to be not only spacious but also cozyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂa perfect combination for a comfortable rest during our layover. . attempted to contact them proved to be quite frustrating as numerous calls went unanswered. Additionally, the pillows provided were not up to par, lacking the expected comfort.our stay coincided with ongoing renovations. Regrettably, the soundproofing seemed inadequate, and we were unable to enjoy a peaceful rest due to the disturbances caused by the construction noise.",null

102,room is very clean and comfy . bothing,null
103,It was very comfortable and easy to sleep in. . Getting between terminals is a confusing and stressful nightmare. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂd avoid KL going forward and go through Singapore or the like to avoid the change in terminals.,null
104,"Great location, although a little bit hard to find initially. . Explanation of additional facilities at check in eg access to lounge for free coffee.  Minor niggle given the short stay.",null
105,It was clean and perfectly situated as we had a 11 hour stopover.  It was great to be able to have a shower before a 13 hour flight . Nothing,null
106,"I liked the convenience of being able to book a short-term hotel stay without having to leave the airport.
My room was very clean, quiet and comfortable.
It was very accessible to restaurants in the airport.
And, there's a premium lounge within steps from the front entrance.
The lounge is not included in your stay, but there is a bar outside of the lounge to sit and have drinks and a light meal.
Everything was very convenient.
Even catching the KLIA Expres was convenient.   It cost only RM 2 Ringit and one stop away to reach the international terminal.
There's also a free bus to KLIA terminal 1, but you have to go outside to catch it.
KLIA Expres was steps away from the Aerotel. . I didn't like not having any windows, but I got over it quickly.
I would suggest that they put some air fresheners in the hallways.   It smelled like someone used the bathroom and stunk up the public hallways.",null

113,Bed was comfortable. . There were no closets and shelves.,null
114,"The room and the bathroom is perfectly clean, just like how the advertisement shown. The AC works fine. For domestic flight, it's very convenient for you to get a good rest before departure, especially every restaurant is nearby. It may be a little pricey, but it fits with it's location and fairness. . The room is a little smaller than I expected in according to the advertisement, but I understand that it's only for 12 hours stay policy. Also, we had some several issues when it comes to the door key card, better make sure the door is locked twice ya. The reception service is decent, could've been better but I bet they're just tired.",null
115,"It is right at the airport among many airport shops and cafes. . Getting there from the arrival terminal is a little tricky. There should be at least one more, clear direction sign in each terminal.",null
116,"Very close to the departure gate. Room was spacy, comfortable bed. Definitely will jave good night sleep while waiting for the flight . A bit pricy after covid 19",null
118,"The hotel is located right in the mall next to Terminal 2 which gives you a great choice of food and shopping options during your stay. . Compared to the rooms I have been staying in before, the rooms with shared shower facilities are a bit more noisy.",null
119,The facilities were great. So clean and comfortable . It was far away from Terminal one. It took an hour to get out. DidnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt realise that you needed to get through immigration and then take bus to Terminal 2. This should be told to customers booking. It was stressful,null
121,"We need to stay because of the layover for 16 hours. The staff is really helpful and the room is spacious. There is several flight information inside the hotel. It's near the departure and easy to find from arrival (follow the sign). . We only stay for 12 hours and after they got us a room turns out the room is not ready (in the middle of cleaning) we waited for around 15 min but they didn't finished. But they helped us to reach receptionist and got us a new room and change the check out time. But we were tired at that time, please do make sure that the room you are giving is ready to use when someone checked in.",null
123,"Room was immaculately clean. Good shower facilities and convenience of location right next to terminal transfer station and restaurants. . Booking restricted by hours instead of by nights. Booked one night, which ended up being 12 hours instead. Was unable to check in on arrival, and had to leave luggage elsewhere for the day.",null
124,"Fast check in, fast check out, easy to find room. . N lobby.  Lighting in the room was too dim. Not so friendly staff.",null
125,"Easy to locate, fast check in, fast check out. Inside airport so easy to find dinner. . Can actually hear next door talking/opening door. Not so friendly staff.",null

Noise from construction somewhere else , so difficult to sleep",null
129,"The location is awesome. We had a long stop over in KL so decided to get a room for 12 hours to get some sleep. We went through immigration and the hotel is a short walk from there. It is basically in the airport and is surrounded by shops and eating places. There is a free shuttle bus to the Mitsui outlet stores which we took and that was very convenient.
The room itself has no windows, was cool, had a very nice bed, clean food quality linen and a clean small bathroom. It was all we needed. Easy check out by dropping your key into the key box in reception. . We asked to check out an hour later but that was expensive and we didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt end up doing it. There was a bit of noise from people in the hallways which kept us awake for a while.",null
130,"Really easy to find - took the KLIA Ekspres train from T1 for RM2 (which is about ÃÂÃÂ£0.35p), even got the ticket in the baggage claim area so avoided the queue at the station (and could use card so didn't need Malaysia money). The hotel is just at the exit from the train and up an elevator. Quick and friendly check-in. The room was bigger than I was expecting, with lovely modern bathroom with excellent walk-in shower, fluffy towels and all the amenities you might need. The bed was reaaaaallllly comfy with good quality linens and pillow choices - I slept like a log! Thought it would be strange not having a window but this made for a better sleep. The coffee shop (Coffee Bean/Tea Leaf) just opposite makes excellent coffee and breakfast bagels. Really easy to then check-in for the next flight at T2 the next day. Perfect for a stopover in between flights and would stay again. . I don't think I've slept as good since!",null
131,"Great location, right outside the escalator to departure area. Amazing place to stay overnight if you have a long layover, or want to spend the night closer to the airport for an earlier flight. . The size of rooms. Booked two rooms of the same kind, one was significantly smaller than the other. It was late in the night when we reached and was just for a night so didnt bother changing the rooms.",null
132,It was just outside the immigration so very easy for connecting flights . The fact I had to go through immigration,null
133,"Generally very comfortable and very clean. The room was also quiet. . Air conditioning system was too cold, and we couldn't understand how to adjust it. Even though we were shown how to set it, it just wouldn't warm up. We had to keep turning it off.",null
134,"Convenient for early morning flights . There are food stations underneath the room, itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs noisy at night that you can hear the tables/ chairs moving all the time. The check in staff didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt inform us any cafe or restaurant available for the daily room booking.",null
135,"It was in the airport terminal and easy to find. The shower was excellent, the room was clean and the bed was comfy. . No window, no teabags. Could only get one channel on TV",null

The bed and room was really comfortable.
The bathroom was really clean . Nothing",null

There was supposed to be soundproofing, but the room was very noisy, with people shouting in the corridor through the night and I could hear the baby in the next room, as well as other noises, so sleep was disturbed.",null

Staff are all good n friendly except for parking security guard.
Deco was nice n good for photo taking which my friends loved. I recommended the place so it was important for me. . We had a driver n when we wanted to enter parking area at the back of Baba Hse, with him in our mpv, guard asked us if we were guests.
We said yes n showed him our room key cards too.
He was very unfriendly and was indignant to allow our car in.
After our driver insisted, only he moved the barrier.
We understand we have to inform the reception upon arrival if we needed parking but since our driver stayed somewhere else we disnt require parking on checking in.
However on check out, he needed to load our luggage and parking in front of hotel was full.
He could have been more polite about the matter. Instead he showed us a nasty face and it was an  upsetting end to our stay there!
So rude!! Must be trained better or hotel will get a bad reputation.",null
152,Great location. Staff very helpful and knowledgeable . When i first entered d room. It has a musky smell.,null

155,"Breakfast, location and comfort all great. The only downside was the very late housekeeping of the rooms- you should let customers know of the alternative on check in . See above - housekeeping at 4pm is ridiculous- thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs nap time after very hot day",null
157,"Visiting Jonker Street area, where you find many intersting shops in historic Nyonya houses, is the best attraction of visiting Malacca. And staying Baba House can be the best way to truly enjoy the area.  The hotel is located right in the middle of the Jonker Street area, and we were quite impressed when we entered the hotel because the building itself is made out of the traditional building, but the interior design is very nicely done by keeping elements of Nyonya houses in a luxury touch. We stayed at Family Suites for three of us, and the room came with a spacious balcony with a bathtub which we didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect to have. We were happy with the spacious room, comfy beds, spacious bathroom with full amenities. . The indoor tables for breakfast were quite limited, and there were no tables for us when we went there around 9am. We couldnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt find any help from staff and were left stranded for quite sometime while there were several staff in the dining area. I wish they could be a little more attentive to help us find a table.",null

163,"Baba house is beautifully designed (in keeping with the peranakan aesthetic), centrally located (one street behind the bustling jonker street), and very clean and new.
The room is an adequate size for a couple, but it would be a squeeze if you needed to add a baby cot.
We didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt try the food in the hotel as there were plenty of good options around. . Welcome drink was just alright.",null
164,"Hotel Design & Location is great . Only 1 small window, and no fan. Because sometimes prefer fan rather Aircond.",null
165,Very good location. The Bed is good. Car Parking is good. I like the design for whole hotel. . No swimming pool. access card not working during the time I check-out (before 12pm),null
166,Minimalist design and simple . Parking entrance can be a challenge. Perhaps a good video on social media or Waze to introduce the rear parking entrance will be good.,null
167,"The facade s so outstanding n blend well into the whole row of shops.
I was impressed they managed to sqz out a rest area on the rooftop for drinks n chit chat.
We managed to rent the bicycles n ride the historical sites nearby.
Parking is in the shade n safe.
We even watch a movie outside at the garden.
The staffs are friendly n responsive to our request.
TQ to Shireen (CRO) for taking care of me n my family. . I would suggest two improvements:
1. Should have a nice smell in the arrival n hall area.  Food smell should b removed from these area.
2. Find a solution to the waste dump at the back.",null
168,"The hotel has designed a first class hotel that is within a heritage building. The rooms are divine and the amenities first class that includes a tanning area on the roof.

Hotel offered us complimentary breakfast which was really sweet of them. We are grateful. . Although breakfast was complimentary, it can definitely be improved to include more variety.

Really thumb up to the friendly staff :)Strong water pressure for shower, we can have a good shower =) .

When we reached there, we were very relieved to see that there was a staff at the reception counter. However, the unresponsiveness to our messages had caused us great distress as we thought we would be stranded. Apparently, the property was understaffed. Despite being overwhelmed with work, the staff, Esjay, was still polite, cheerful and very helpful.",null
249,"Room rates fair, clean and comfort . Room rates are fair but wasting pay for car parking. As a hotel rent should have special pay rates for guest but normal charges too expensive.

The elevator system is unusual. If you want to leave, you have to go into one lift to the top floor. Then you transfer to another lift, which goes down to the entrance.

My daughter said that she is her favourite waitress..:)I think her name was Rachel at the front desk, offered me free breakfast throughout my stay although my booking was without breakfast, then also offered me free extra bed if i ever need it for my kids, then also no waiting time during check in as the room was ready, otherwise we would have to wait for another 2-3 hours to comply with the check-in time. On top of that, i was also surprised with the famous Grand Hyatt JP Terrace pineapple tart which i intend to buy actually that day.

450,"Room is luxuriously decorated. Marbled tops and flooring, mood lightings, floor to ceiling windows, lushious bathrobes and towels, crisp bedding, quiet and peaceful. Absolute beauty. My room view overlooks the KLCC park and beautiful KL skyline.
Breakfast at Thirty8 was amazing and why I chose to stay here. Vast selection of cuisine and easy to personalize to fit own taste. My favs were the vast selection of western food, pastries, middle eastern dips, pancakes with maple syrup, free flow of smoked salmon with cream and capers and freshly pressed juices. I stayed here for three nights and there was always a different and delectable selection everyday. Can not be bored.
Hospitality was great. Staff were always helpful and ready to help, especially during breakfasts. I think these personalized touches will keep guests coming back here. From the ground floor entrance all the way to checkout, I was always greeted with a smile. They called to offer housekeeping services on different times when I signalled Do Not Disturb sign during the day. . TV channels were distrupted during bad weather (Astro).
The mattress was a bit hard for my preference and the feather pillows were too 'fluffy' for my neck.
Complimentary toiletries were basic. No razors or combs.
The music from the lobby can be a bit loud to hear in the early mornings.
From the basement car park to the lobby lifts there were steps and stairs. Kinda difficult to maneuver when you have heavy roller luggage.
When I arrived at the hotel parking to check in on a weekday, it was blocked at it's front entrance as it was full. I was assisted by a staff to enter the parking at a difference entrance or I have to park at the open area next to the hotel. Thankfully I found a parking at basement, but if I had to park at the open area, it will be very inconvinient to walk over to the hotel with luggages.

Naturally, all the staff members in the club room and the restaurant whom I encountered were friendly and had pleasant smiles.

I highly recommend this room when you stay at this hotel. The hotel is conveniently located in KLCC, making it easy to access shopping and dining options.Furthermore, the breakfast was excellent, offering a wide variety of fresh foods. We thoroughly enjoyed the culinary offerings during our two-day stay. I would love to return to this hotel if I have the chance to visit KL in Malaysia again.

The location was convenient, but the locality is not the best lot of shady looking places and people around I wouldn't fancy going out of the hotel at night, the hotel itself is nice but the bathroom door lock wasn't working, and you cannot close it all the way which was a bit of a low point.

So for a child there was no way to adust. Even 1 person also cannot sleep properly on these twin beds. They are this much small. So requested them to change room to Queen Bed. Omg this room no. 2406 is like 10-15 Sqm. only. I am just 5 feet 7 inches average height guy and how would a European People sleep in these rooms? Room was so small that there was hardly any space left to move around. We spent 4 nights in a fear to fall out of the bed and hurt ourselves. I am a hotel manager myself based in Phuket Thailand. Our hotel is 3 Star and our rooms are double the size of this hilton's room. It felt like Hilton was just in the name. Also at the reception there is always only 1 girl, even at the peak hours of check-in and check-out. Come on, at least have 2 receptionist always.

Not exactly in the city center, but main attractions (Merdaka Square, Sultan Mosque, Jalan Petaling) are in walking distance.- I really like the concept of mixing between comfort + privacy of the hotel and vibes of the hostel. They have common area, central kitchen, laundry room and mini gym on 12th floor where you can hang out. - The hotel have QR code that you can scan + download mini map and guide (in pdf) to see what to do and where to go around the area. No plastic water bottle in the room but there're water purifier on every floor. I'm glad they're environmental concerned and really well thought of all the details and experience of the guests. I love it so much!- Checking in and out were smooth. The reception staffs are nice and helpful.  - I feel safe during my stay.- Overall I think it's really worth the money. The price is very good compare to this level of property and service in other cities of SEA (Bangkok, Singapore).  I'd recommend and will go back again. .

So the late checkout is perfect! Toilet is CLEAN and DRY! There is also a laundry upstairs and a work and play area, has a kitchen too! Honestly if I am choosing a place for a long stay, this place would be it. . TV no Netflix application :( and during my stay, the bath soap was almost empty, but when i checked out, they asked if there were any problems, and I have let them know. So it should be ok! There really isn't anything else that I would complain about.",null

The overall experience at the hotel remains positive, with its cleanliness and satisfying breakfast serving as notable highlights. . However, one aspect to consider is the hotel's distance from the subway station, which is a bit on the far side. This minor inconvenience becomes more noticeable, especially on rainy days, when it becomes necessary to be equipped with an umbrella or raincoat to navigate the distance and reach the hotel comfortably.",null

Super convenient as this is where all the action is. . Staff were reasonably friendlyYou need to remember to switch the water heater on before showering else you gonna have a COLD shower.They could be abit flexible with check-ins - I had to pay a full day even though i arrived about 3 hours before the day ended.Water basin in shower only has 1 temperate - COLD - does not get HOT.Wifi password printed incorrectly making it unclear to quickly capture and use.If your room is close to the lift, be WARNED - each time the lift comes to your level it makes a musical noise - very distracting if you a Light sleeper.The light from the smoke alarm flashes especially during the night - highly distracting.Incorrect items written on bookings.com which was NOT offered:* They DO NOT have a forex desk* NO - there is NO key - it was a CARD",null

Oh, laundry super reliable and accessible! Very good price for a big machine! . As other ppl commenting here, it would be nice to have something sweet for breakfast as well. Fruit maybe?

The hotel has a free parking on the territory. Probably a good choice for those who have an event in exhibition hall. . To me it seemed that the hotel is getting a bit old, there were stains in my room (on carpets and on the walls) and the cleanliness could definitely had been better. It is visible that the hotel hasn't received any larger refurbishments lately and therefore it looks a bit worn out in some aspects. Of course it actually depends on what you compare it with, because probably compared to many other Asian hotels it is still relatively good option with regards to cleanliness.

Got washing machine and dryer. We didnt bring any dirty clothes cause we washed them everyday! :) . Checked in/out at the basement level. There is no signal there. If check in, need to follow the grab driver to the lobby for internet connection cause the grab driver can't refresh our grab amount. After checked out, need to go to lobby also for signal so we can order a grab. But we can't wait with luggage at the lobby or else will be compound charges. Checked out time too early at 11am. 12pm sounds good.",null

899,"CLEAN! I loved our stay in this gorgeous apartment. The wifi was incredibly quick and consistent. Each room in the apartment was very comfortable to be in. the shower was delightful with amazing water pressure. Appreciated all the additional security throughout the whole property. . -I wouldn't say the workers are kind or nice, but they also are not rude. Besides when we got the keys not a single worker on the property would look at us, greet us, or even offer a simple smile. Everyone seemed very robotic. Great place for introverts!-This kitchen is actually not meant to be used - they don't provide ANY cookware so unless you bring your own material don't expect to cook anything besides in the microwave.",null
900,"A very comfortable, large apartment with amenities such as a washer and dryer, a large kitchen with a fridge, microwave, kettle, and hob. The apartment was on the 18th floor, so the view of the city was impressive. There are 2 outdoor swimming pools in the building, one on the 12th floor and the other on the 52nd floor. The views from them are amazing.  Patronas Towers are visible from uper swimming pool. Many people were afraid whether the owners would return the deposit that was left at the beginning, but there was no problem with it, I received the money after 3 days on my PayPal account. . There are two forks, two knives, two spoons and two cups in the apartment. In apartment was missing a plate and a bowl to prepare food. However, this is a small inconvenience that certainly did not affect the stay.",null
901,Lovely room with a great view. Super nice bed and pool. . Mechanical parking is very difficult and easily took up half an hour of our check-in and check-out.,null
903,"I had a fantastic experience at Pavilion Ceylon Hills and would like to share a glowing review. The first thing that struck me was the incredibly friendly staff. Their warm hospitality and eagerness to assist made my stay truly memorable.
The location of Pavilion Ceylon Hills is also a major highlight. Situated in a prime spot, it offers easy access to various attractions, dining options, and shopping centers, making it a convenient choice for travelers.
Moreover, the view from Pavilion Ceylon Hills is simply breathtaking. Whether it's the city skyline or the surrounding natural beauty, every glance from the windows or balcony was a treat for the eyes.
And let's not forget about the excellent value for money. The quality of service, the comfortable accommodations, and the overall experience far exceeded the cost of my stay, making it a budget-friendly gem.
All in all, Pavilion Ceylon Hills exceeded my expectations with its friendly staff, superb location, picturesque views, and outstanding value for money. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a delightful stay in this beautiful city. . Nothing",null
904,Brand new . Checking in was a hassle as they do not have any specific counters.,null
906,"Location is good, and the overall accomodation is ok. . Omg, where to begin? Don't book this, you will wanna leave immediately! First, you'll get hundred directions about check in, they make it so complicated and complex because they don't own the building, but who's problem is that? I don't need to know and to care about that. They don't have wifi in lobby so if you are using grab (uber) you have to go to lobby then to 13th floor then back to lobby to see if everything is ok with your grab driver. They don't have anything in kitchen, anything!!!! Not even a plate! It's nice kitchen, but it's empty kitchen! Never again!",null

911,"Really new property with lovely swimming pool and brand new gym. The staff were very helpful during our stay. . Only downside was there being a full kitchen - Hobs, Microwave etc but no plates, no cups, no pans. Seems a shame to have this facility if you cannot use it - would be helpful if the pointed this out so people knew before booking. But apart from that small thing we enjoyed our stay here and no other complaints!",null

*Near to the place that i like to go..such as..jalan alor...and so on...

*Basement 1 have wifi ya (but need to ask first) ..because none signal of mobile devices there. . *within 3 days i stay there things that i think they cak improve is.

-give more clear information (such as video) (via whatapps )to the guest that first time go there the direction of office to check in at b1...because it's a bit hard for me ..
-and first day i go in the room I'm looking for a pan and a bowl right but don't have ..so i ask the person incharge that day (via WhatsApp ) on 7th.he only say the they don't provide...i means why having an induction cooker if doesn't provide a bowl or pan right...and when the time i want to check out already i personal ask the person in charged at office at b1 (he say still on the way the things that theyy ordered that why they still not provided the bowls or a pan.) totally understand because this place is really new ..
-the things that I'm a bit annoyed is .. cannot wait at the lobby for the grab ya...the management of the building is such unreasonable (not the perfect host) because i ask the person at desk to check out
They cannot do anything about it because they only owned little share for the room that they have there.(totally understand).
-what the point of having a lobby if can't use right?~_~.",null
913,"Great place to stay in Kuala Lumpur. Best beds and pillows that I have come across in any accommodation. Everything in a great spaced apartment . Two towels for 3 days for two people. Some of the rules, such as not sitting in the lobby, are ridiculous. The check in and check out is in the basement and kinda feels unsafe",null
914,Facilities were good. Location is great. Conveniently near to places of interest. . Only allows Youtube access since without Netflix account,null
917,Very good . So clean n comfortable??,null
918,"High standard apartment with good quality furniture in a well-kept building with nice pool. Also very well located near Bintang area. But make sure you read on ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ . Where to start? The check in procedure is mega complex. You are not allowed to enter the lobby, but instead go to an underground parking lot, out of reach of 4G. Feels really dodgy.
There I discovered  thereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs no cleaning included at all, nor change of towels or bedsheets. Booking.com doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt mention that. Better not spill something, because there are no cleaning tools provided in the room either.
YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll get only 1 towel per person (not even an extra hand towel), not replaced for a full week ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs simply disgusting.
And then there are the 100 mindblowing rules, most of them enforced with explicit fines, including forbidden to put shoes in front of the door, sit in the lobby (wth is a lobby for???), obligatory change of clothes after swimming, only halal food allowed to be cooked ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ although thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs no problem, since every cupboard in the kitchen is completely empty (not even 1 single plate). So donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect to use the kitchen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ there are no pans or anything else. Maybe better, because youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂd have to dry your dishes with your 1 towel.
Security guards everywhere (like a chaperone looking over me swimming every second), telling you immediately if you do something wrong. And the cameras everywhere look down on you to see if you follow the rules (IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm not being sarcastic, itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs clearly stated in a document I had to sign at check in!).",null

922,Location wise are ok. But youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be annoyed by one staff Botak (Bald) guy. Your stayed later will be a nightmare. . ThereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs one Botak (Bald) guy very rude. With unforgivable attitude. Because of one staff youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve ruined your reputation of the place. I will definitely campaign the bad reputation to all of my contact and public. Good luck.,null

My third time staying there, and I will definitely come back again. . I was a little disappointed that the swimming pool is no more, and that the bar no longer serves cocktails and beers.

The room that we were in is the only access point to their water pump.

939,It's clean with old fashioned decor and furniture. I love the cosiness of the place. . Should have a bathroom on the lower floor. Floor creaks and TV doesn't work. The fan downstairs doesn't seem to work at times. Good to have aircon at the ground floor but then that might increase the room rates I reckon,null

Breakfast selections were good and besides the Nescafe machine, they have another coffee machine with freshly ground beans and tasted great. Staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay there. . Though we can hear noises from the street at times, but it doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt bother us much. Some of doors misaligned can be a challenge whenever you tried to close and lock, however, just need to get used to it and all will be fine. One of our bathroom's waters canÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt seem to turn on warm, luckily the few days weather was hot so doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt affect us much.

The location is very close to Station 8 of CAT Free Bus and Komtar. Eateries close by as well. There is a ceiling fan in our bedroom, which helps circulate the cool air, which is greatly appreciated. . We can hear the motorcycles down the street from time to time.

1000,"I love the unit that we stayed, there's 4 of us so we got the unit that is outside of the main building. It has 2 floors and 2 bedrooms. The interior is great, really gave the antique vibe. AC is good. Breakfast is not bad. It can have more options but the unit is really close to eateries so you can go have roti canai outside if you want. And the location is in walking distance to Chowrasta, ais tingkap and also teochew cendol and all that. Super convenient. . The place is generally clean but I think a bit of an upkeep is needed. For example the bathroom can be descaled because the glass looks like it had watermarks. The TV seriously needs to be upgraded, we can barely watch any chanels, and maybe add a mattress topper on some beds? I still think it is a good unit but just needs sprucing up and more TLC.",null

I would recommend people with big groups to choose this hotel to stay because of the spacious hall room, and it makes you feel like you are at home. . The bathroom water pressure is low, and the coldness of the air conditioners is average. The creaky wood floors and stairs are among the things that require attention.",null
1004,"Heritage esthetics is very nice! The room is gorgeous! Everything is aesthetically pleasing. . The TV system is quite unwatchable (not a big deal) and its speaker system is rubbish. But my main gripe is the lack of parking facilities, although there are tons of public parking around.",null

Location in a quiet area of Georgetown, away from tourist traps but close enough for sightseeing. Beautiful garden and common spaces also comfortable. Felt lucky to have found it. Extended stay for another night. . After extending our stay for another night, the water in the jacuzzi didn't stop running, so we inevitably flooded some of the bathroom. We were told this bath has problems and we had to let it leak for the rest of the stay (into the bathtub). The room seems to have suffered from previous flooding, with a makeshift carpet messily taped to the floor by the bathroom to try to conceal it. This unfortunately contrasted greatly with the amazing work originally done on the renovation of the historical building.The room had a balcony to the beautiful garden below but loud and hot air conditioning units were installed on it, so we couldn't really use it except to dry our hand-washed laundry (very quick and effective for this).WiFi and internet connection in the building was slow.",null

Excellent view . The Parkroyal Resort boasts an exceptional location that guarantees a delightful beach experience with breathtaking views. The breakfast provided is outstanding, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. During my visit with my wife to celebrate my birthday, the hotel went above and beyond by decorating our room with balloons and flowers, as well as surprising us with a small cakeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂan incredibly thoughtful gesture.
However, I did encounter a few areas where the hotel could improve, considering its five-star status. Firstly, the corridors on the 10th level lacked air conditioning, leading to uncomfortable conditions with high humidity. Additionally, the elevators were cramped and lacked proper ventilation, resulting in a hot and uncomfortable experience, particularly when sharing the lift with many other guests. Furthermore, it was noticeable that the resort only had two lifts available, which seemed insufficient considering the size and capacity of the hotel.
As a five-star establishment, it would be beneficial for the Parkroyal Resort to address these issues and ensure that the overall guest experience matches the high standards expected from a luxury hotel.",null

The local coffee is really bad not even matching ""normal"" standard, Penang is so famous for good local coffee, suggest removal of that koisk as the fresh brew coffee came out from the machine is much better, or at least the coffee koisk can use the coffee coming out from the coffee machine instead, we expect at least standard matching other shangri-la in the world, but the breakfast buffet 30 % of the items need significant catching up.",null

The breakfast was generous, with a good range of options. Plus monkeys! . The location is a bit isolated from Georgetown, so dining and entertainment options outside the resort are limited, if you're after those things.

Having the toilet in a clear glass area attached to the main bathroom was strange. Surely it could be frosted glass for a bit more privacy. You also have to walkthrough the lobby to get to the pool and take a seperate lift. I felt odd walking through the beautiful lobby still wet.,null
1385,"Breakfast, Dinner and The room was superb. . The stay as a whole was amazing.",null
1386,"Your humble and polite staff esp that sweet lady, May July.  We just had to ask about her name. Also, you have barista for my coffee instead of from machine . There was only 1 bathrobe in the room and there wasnt much selection of tv channels. Should have smart tv",null
1387,"Everything was superb..from the bed to the bathroom..not to mention the dinner and breakfast spread was absolutely delicious..Comfy bed, clean bathroom and complimentary coffee in the room. Booked for our anniversary, the hotel gave us a nice mini flower bouquet which i think was a sweet gesture..thank you! Will definitely come here again! . As we only stayed for a night therefore I didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt bring any toiletries..however they only provide one toothbrush in my room..there were 2 boxes but the other one is empty..maybe they didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt check it properly, also the conditioner in our room was nearly empty, shouldÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve refill before guests went in.",null

1393,"Remarkable experience with this hotel and was so pleased with the service.  The room was spacious and the bed so comfy, we got two bolsters and six pillows. The design just wonderful,ÃÂÃÂ  the bathtub with the tv. Breakfast was fantastic!SARAH the customer service, went above and beyond to help me find the perfect birthday dinner place and make a reservation for us! She even approached us after check out and ask about our dinner and share her ideas what to do in KL. Its just her passion! . Here's a weird thing. We checked in around 4pm and left around 8pm. When we returned to the room around 12am plus, the bed was already made. What prompted them to enter the room at night? The only thing they did was make our bed. Even our coffee cup wasn't cleared, the towel wasn't changed, and the water bottle wasn't replaced. We just checked in, showered, and went out to dinner, so we didn't request room service because there was none to clean",null
1394,"Extraordinary breakfast buffet - actually with all the cuisines and offerings, quite over the top! Pool glorious.  Sara, the only Female Concierge in Malaysia.  Front steps greeting bellmen in colonial costumes and Pith Helmets!  Corner room with fab views.  Room amenities and design.  Easy TV channel access, including CNA. . - first time entering the room, both TVs were turned on, to pablum station, volume low.  CREEPY!(Ps - TV in the bathroom - yikes, a bit much)- the takeaway breakfast provided for my 530 am departure was appreciated for the hot coffee and fresh guava juice, as requested, but the food was offerings were fresh fruit (fine) and five pieces of pastry only, lovely pieces in themselves, but way too carb loaded: ached for some  protein - e.g., an egg hard boiled or over-hard, cheese, yoghurt - SOMETHING for balance.  - location not very walkable, e.g., to other restaurants, convenient store, shops.",null

1400,the breakfast and the room are excellent! the staff are so friendly even with the busy occasion . the swimming pool should be better . The cleanliness of the pool can be improve,null
1401,Staff are very welcoming and helpful with our inquires. Breakfast was really good with a wide range of dishes to choose from. There are lots it different restaurants within the hotel and the food was good (bit pricey but expected). 2 outdoor pools which were clean and well maintained (not the best views). . As itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs right next to a main road it is difficult to walk around to different places. The train station is across the road which is great otherwise you can get taxis to your different destinations.,null
1402,"Every detail was immaculate. . Beautiful interior, thoughtful design, top notch amenities.",null
1403,"Perfect weekend getaway with my wife. I love the classic colonial facade, comfortable room and friendly staff. . Average breakfast at the Colonial Cafe and I don't understand how the parking charges work. Guests should have paid a flat charge rate.",null
1405,"The overall ambience of the place. It feels and exclusive stay and not just a normal hotel visit. The room is very nice with the bathtub at just the nice location. The buffet breakfast spread is quite plenty,leaving you with a very full stomach. Not forgetting the drinks are not generic. Teas are just your normal ones. But the coffees are made to order,not your normal press and wait espresso machine. . The tv channels choices  are a bit limited. The refrigerator space is limited. And our room were entered by cleaning staff during the afternoon when we were out in the city. do put the Do Not Disturb sign even if you're not in the room. Also be reminded that there's no complimentary parking. You will be charged rm15/day. But bring your card to the counter so that you'll get unlimited entry per day.",null
1406,"Fast check-in, great facilities, great view. . Room temperature is not cold enough, surprisingly the corridor is much cooler. Breakfast quality is not consistent, week days is 10-time better than breakfast on the weekend.",null

1409,The staff were very attentive and the service is excellent. The colonial charm and flair is also great. The cocktails at the Colonial Cafe  are a must try and the breakfast buffet is great! . The room couldÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve been a bit cleaner. ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs still clean but can be cleaner,null

The vegetarian food options were very limited. Further, the Contango restaurant was closed for renovation, restricting the options available.",null
1417,"The colonial ambience is amazing from the moment you walk through the door with high quality rooms to match.  The building clearly has a long history and this is evident, although the hotel has been recently upgraded.  It is very clean and beautifully maintained. The staff could not have been more helpful and attentive. Breakfast was good with a lovey variety of choice. . Our only issue was that itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs not a good location for popping out to find a bar or restaurant - in fact it is quite awkward to walk anywhere.  We did find a nice route through the park at the back of the hotel, but the the more more popular areas are a good 20 minute walk or a taxi ride.",null
1418,"Airy welcoming reception. Helpful cheerful staff.Wonderful ambience to the whole hotel, it was like stepping back in time. Good food and cocktails, delightful live music with a jazz singer pianist, accompanied by double bass or a trumpeter. Hotel is scout a 20min walk by the tiver to Central Market.

I liked everything about the stay really.",null
1429,"The pool & breakfast is quite good! . The toilet was smelly, the bed was a bit hard & uncomfortable, please provide floor mat in front of the toilet next time, it was so slippery. The staffs could be a bit more friendly or at least smile to the customers.",null

1440,"The food is delicious and several type of foods are provided. The tables and chairs are properly arranged. While eating breakfast, we can watch TV. The ambiance of the place is good. Taking food and drinks by yourself, self-service. . Available parking lot is quite limited, however, customer can park nearby the hotel with no charge.

The wardrobe is just a piece of board put together. So it was nice if you just went there only to sleep. . For the breakfast. The staff didn't take into account for it's cleanliness. The kaya and planta was moldy. The fries was full with ants. The iron board was full with holes, so need to cover it up before using it.",null
1446,"The stay was good and value for the price. The air conditioning was very good, if anything too cold even after adjusting the temperature. . The only issue was a slight musty odour probably from the condensation in the room but it was not a problem for me.",null

I have to take shower in a very cold water. totally not worth it. already complaint but nothing is done.2. ceiling near toilet was leaked with a hole. rainy season make it worse. the floor is wet every time since rain came on and off and sometimes heavy, hence the hole couldn't bear any longer.3. room is so-so but could be better cleaned. 4. playing area is available downstairs but is not maintained well.5. swimming pool is available but water not properly maintained.",null

Despite quite far away, easily connected Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Subang Jaya KLIA/KLIA2 via several major tollways nearby (if youÃÂll pardon PuchongÃÂs rush hour traffics). Also, metro station (Puchong Perdana LRT Station) 8-10 minutes (of walking) away. Taxi e-hailing services available, may take time reach hotel. used department store high-end supermarket downstairs, anymore. Building Rooms hotel quite new establishment. Interiors still okay-looking quite minimal. Lobby located Level 6, Ground Floor. Carpark free charge well-secured. Rooms IÃÂve stayed quite spacious comfortable. always love rooms assigned me, matter type room booked for. Bathrooms quite spacious too. Toiletries locally-sourced certainly lack luxury touch. hey, least paraben-free. Restaurant Experience Breakfast buffet variations quite limited, quality-wise acceptable. Staffs also friendly professional. Gold Diamond members usually treated complimentary Lite Evening Tea session everyday. Conclusion hotel really good value much kinder wallet. stayed several times wonÃÂt hesitate stay again.
