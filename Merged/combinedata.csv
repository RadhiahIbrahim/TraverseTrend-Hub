10,Johor,7 Heaven Boutique Hotel,2023,5,"July 11, 2023","Very friendly staff, with the most important parameter being that this is the first time I am seeing such an extremely clean and hygienic property completely non-smoking, endless cups of coffee with smoking zone outside, the quiet coffee table area being soothed by the fountain in a pool of open aquarium with lovely fishes, everything so clean that sitting outside for a coffee and a smoke and gazing at the pool with its bubbling pot of water and the sprinkling fountains and the swaying fishes, with the gentle breeze from the woods opposite on the brow, the experience was meditative. All around the property the positive vibes on all the posters with pearls of wisdom and motivational words, with the beautiful wall paint and hangings, the 7 Heaven Boutique Hotel really made us feel like in a peaceful heaven. Inside the room, everything was just right and adequate for a comfortable and soothing stay. Really surprised, and now really happy, to have discovered such a 'family nest' in a quite place. The location is also excellent for business people and visitors of all kinds. Nearby availability of all kinds of food and beverages, banks, shops, temples, malls, hospital and other utility services make the location ideal for visitors of all types.

Marbled tops and flooring, mood lightings, floor to ceiling windows, lushious bathrobes and towels, crisp bedding, quiet and peaceful. Absolute beauty. My room view overlooks the KLCC park and beautiful KL skyline.
Breakfast at Thirty8 was amazing and why I chose to stay here. Vast selection of cuisine and easy to personalize to fit own taste. My favs were the vast selection of western food, pastries, middle eastern dips, pancakes with maple syrup, free flow of smoked salmon with cream and capers and freshly pressed juices. I stayed here for three nights and there was always a different and delectable selection everyday. Can not be bored.
Hospitality was great. Staff were always helpful and ready to help, especially during breakfasts. I think these personalized touches will keep guests coming back here. From the ground floor entrance all the way to checkout, I was always greeted with a smile. They called to offer housekeeping services on different times when I signalled Do Not Disturb sign during the day. . TV channels were distrupted during bad weather (Astro).
The mattress was a bit hard for my preference and the feather pillows were too 'fluffy' for my neck.
Complimentary toiletries were basic. No razors or combs.
The music from the lobby can be a bit loud to hear in the early mornings.
From the basement car park to the lobby lifts there were steps and stairs. Kinda difficult to maneuver when you have heavy roller luggage.
When I arrived at the hotel parking to check in on a weekday, it was blocked at it's front entrance as it was full. I was assisted by a staff to enter the parking at a difference entrance or I have to park at the open area next to the hotel. Thankfully I found a parking at basement, but if I had to park at the open area, it will be very inconvinient to walk over to the hotel with luggages.

Naturally, all the staff members in the club room and the restaurant whom I encountered were friendly and had pleasant smiles. I was genuinely delighted.Afterward, we entered our impeccably clean and beautifully appointed room and were thrilled with the view of the Twin Towers, especially when they were illuminated at night. I highly recommend this room when you stay at this hotel. The hotel is conveniently located in KLCC, making it easy to access shopping and dining options.Furthermore, the breakfast was excellent, offering a wide variety of fresh foods. We thoroughly enjoyed the culinary offerings during our two-day stay. I would love to return to this hotel if I have the chance to visit KL in Malaysia again.

Also very well located near Bintang area. But make sure you read on ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ . Where to start? The check in procedure is mega complex. You are not allowed to enter the lobby, but instead go to an underground parking lot, out of reach of 4G. Feels really dodgy.
There I discovered  thereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs no cleaning included at all, nor change of towels or bedsheets. Booking.com doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt mention that. Better not spill something, because there are no cleaning tools provided in the room either.
YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll get only 1 towel per person (not even an extra hand towel), not replaced for a full week ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs simply disgusting.
And then there are the 100 mindblowing rules, most of them enforced with explicit fines, including forbidden to put shoes in front of the door, sit in the lobby (wth is a lobby for???), obligatory change of clothes after swimming, only halal food allowed to be cooked ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ although thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs no problem, since every cupboard in the kitchen is completely empty (not even 1 single plate). So donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect to use the kitchen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ there are no pans or anything else. Maybe better, because youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂd have to dry your dishes with your 1 towel.
Security guards everywhere (like a chaperone looking over me swimming every second), telling you immediately if you do something wrong.

The breakfast provided is outstanding, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. During my visit with my wife to celebrate my birthday, the hotel went above and beyond by decorating our room with balloons and flowers, as well as surprising us with a small cakeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂan incredibly thoughtful gesture.
However, I did encounter a few areas where the hotel could improve, considering its five-star status. Firstly, the corridors on the 10th level lacked air conditioning, leading to uncomfortable conditions with high humidity. Additionally, the elevators were cramped and lacked proper ventilation, resulting in a hot and uncomfortable experience, particularly when sharing the lift with many other guests. Furthermore, it was noticeable that the resort only had two lifts available, which seemed insufficient considering the size and capacity of the hotel.
As a five-star establishment, it would be beneficial for the Parkroyal Resort to address these issues and ensure that the overall guest experience matches the high standards expected from a luxury hotel.",Montaser,Positive,0.306724138

Taxi e-hailing services available, may take time reach hotel. used department store high-end supermarket downstairs, anymore. Building Rooms hotel quite new establishment. Interiors still okay-looking quite minimal. Lobby located Level 6, Ground Floor. Carpark free charge well-secured. Rooms IÃÂve stayed quite spacious comfortable. always love rooms assigned me, matter type room booked for. Bathrooms quite spacious too.
